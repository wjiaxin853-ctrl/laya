"""HTTP server exposing Laya over TypeSafe Jev's ``/v1/systemone`` wire protocol.

Laya's ``predict()`` output is already schema-compatible with the Jev decision
API -- ``choice`` / ``score`` / ``noul`` answers and a ``{input_tokens,
output_tokens}`` usage block -- so a client written against Jev (for example the
`hs-jev` Haskell client) can point its ``baseUrl`` at this server and keep
working unchanged. All this module adds is the HTTP surface Laya itself does not
ship: a ``POST /v1/systemone`` route, an optional bearer check, and a health
probe.

Configuration is entirely via environment variables so the same entry point
serves a laptop dev run and a systemd unit:

=========================  ============================================  =========

``LAYA_DEVICE`` is a preference, not a guarantee: an ``Agent`` that asks for a
GPU it cannot get falls back to CPU silently and keeps answering correctly.
``/health`` reports where a resident checkpoint actually computes, using the
same helpers the MCP status tool uses (``laya.mcp.device``).

Imports of heavy dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, torch via Router) are all
deferred into the functions that need them, so ``import laya.serve`` stays cheap
and touches no GPU -- which is what keeps the Nix ``pythonImportsCheck`` honest.
